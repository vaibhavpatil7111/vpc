# VPC Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Automation

## Overview

This project provides Infrastructure as Code (IaC) scripts written in Terraform for automating the deployment of a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on the AWS cloud platform.

## Features

- **VPC Configuration:** Define the core components of an AWS VPC, including subnets, route tables, and security groups.
- **Modular Structure:** Organize the Terraform codebase into modular components for better maintainability and scalability.
- **Customization:** Easily customize VPC parameters such as CIDR blocks, subnet configurations, and security rules.
- **Version Control:** Leverage the power of version control to track changes and collaborate on infrastructure modifications.

## Prerequisites

Before using the Terraform scripts, ensure that you have:

- [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) installed on your local machine.
- AWS credentials configured with the necessary permissions.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Vaibhavpatil7111/vpc-terraform-Iaac-github.git
    cd vpc-terraform-Iaac-github
    ```

2. Initialize the Terraform configuration:

    ```bash
    terraform init
    ```

3. Customize the `variables.tf` file as needed.

4. Review the Terraform plan:

    ```bash
    terraform plan
    ```

5. Apply the changes to create the VPC:

    ```bash
    terraform apply
    ```

6. Confirm the changes when prompted.
